# Javascript_Practice_FCC

- The aim of this project is to really go back to basics with my JS and work on some core vanilla JS that i haven't used to much in recent history. Having focused on ReactJS quite a bit prior. Ive done this by following the FreeCodeCamp youtube video of 15 different JS projects. However, rather than straight copying, i have decided to add the twist of trying to work out the JS myself and see if i can achieve similar results.

## Task 1: 

- The first task was a random colour generator.
